# soarFitness.app

This app was designed for Personal Trainers, but can be used by any Fitness Enthusiast.  As a *Certified Personal Trainer* my wife had some great ideas on ways to quickly assess a clients fitness level.  Her goal was a sort of task runner that could quickly gather a clients info. and instantly provide feedback on key fitness matrices.

Since I build apps, I made it.  It was developed using AngularJS.

Feel free to play around with it [here](http://www.soar.paulhirschi.com), but bear in mind it is still a work in progress.
